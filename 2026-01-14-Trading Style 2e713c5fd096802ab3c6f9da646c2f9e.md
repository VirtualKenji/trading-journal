Vocabulary:

[VWAP BASICS]

Think of a vWAP as a dynamic range formed by volume, not just price. The vWAPs I use for trading are fixed time interval vWAPs.

A vWAP is the line at the center of that range
VAH = Range High
VAH 2SD (2 standard deviations) = External Range High
VAL = Range Low
VAL 2SD (2 standard deviations) = External Range Low

In other words:
Value = Value Area. "Accepting back into value" means price coming from external (outside range) back to value (inside range)
Edge = VAH / VAL. Both of these are the "edges" of value. If value = a dynamic range, VAH and VAL = range high and range low.
Mean - vWAP / POC. Or the "middle of range", or the "middle of value".

dVAP = Daily vWAP - resets every day
wVWAP = Weekly vWAP - resets at the start of every week
mVWAP = Monthly vWAP - resets at the 1st day or every month
qVWAP = Quarterly vWAP - resets at the 1st day or every quarter
yVWAP = Yearly vWAP - resets at the 1st day or every year (Jan 1)

Comp = vWAPs that are created between two points in time that I choose
cVAH = Comp Value Area High
cVAL = Comp Value Area Low
POC = point of control, or the point withint the comp where the most trading volume happens (POC is always somewhere in between cVAH and cVAL)

Aside from Comp, each of these vWAPs have their own value areas / ranges. For example yVAL 2SD = External Range Low of the Yearly vWAP
For Comps, there are no external range low or high. There is no such thing as cVAH 2SD or cVAL 2SD.

Higher Timeframe vWAP levels are more important than lower timeframe vWAP levels, so when actioning Intraday Trades, it is always a good idea to stack LTF levels with HTF levels

[vWAP SHAPE = MARKET REGIME]

The slope of the vWAP helps determine the bias of that specific timeframe:

dVWAP Sloping upwards - daily bias is bullish
wVWAP Sloping downwards - weekly bias is downwards
mVWAP is flat = monthly bias is flat

All 3 can occur at the same time, so it is just a matter of which time frame I want to focus on.
When vWAPs Slope, trend-based trading setups work best (breakout, breakdown, trend continuation, trend reclaim, EMAs, mean to edge, etc)
When vWAPs are flat, range-based setups work best (mean reversion, longing from range low, shorting from range high, dalai lama mean reversions etc)

[CLINIC TRENDS]

Momentum Indicators that work best during range markets. Visually, they are 2 curving lines that work across one another.

Clinic H4 Trend = H4 EMA 100 + H4 EMA 200
Clinic Daily Trend = 1D EMA 100 + 1D EMA 200
Clinic Weekly Trend = 1W EMA 100 + 1W EMA 200
* true for all timeframes, but not equally valid for all time frames

[USING CLINIC TRENDS TO GAUGE MOMENTUM / TREND]

A. Short term Trend based on slope:
* sloping upwards = immediately bullish
* sloping downards = immediately bearish

B. Longer Term Trends based on locations of both EMAs relative to each in the same timeframe
* EMA 100 above EMA 200 for H4 Clinic Trend = H4 longer term bullish
* EMA 200 above EMA 100 for H4 Clinic Trend = H4 longer term bearish
* true for all timeframs

Why?
* Because the placement of both EMAs in a clinic trend relative to each other takes more time to resolve than a simple up slope vs down slope
For example
* The clinic H4 trend's 100 EMA line over its 200 EMA line = bullish momentum on the H4 chart
* The clinic 1D trend's 200 EMA line over its 100 EMA line = bearish momentum for 1D chart

C. Longest Term Trends based on locations of two Clinic Trends Relative to each other

```
* Long term uptrend = Lower Time Frame Clinic Trend above Higher Time Frame Clinic Trend (example - Clinic Daily on top of Clinic Weekly Trend = long term bullish, same logic applies to all Clinic trends)
* Long term downtrend = Higher Time Frame Clinic Trend above Lower Time Frame Clinic Trend (example - Clinic Daily above H4 Clinic Trend = bearish)

```

Clinic Trend Flip =

[GAP FILL / EMA GAP FILLS]

Setup Based on Trading 2 Separate Clinic Trends "as a Range"

The gap between the Clinic Daily and Clinic Weekly can be traded as a range (long from top of clinic daily and take profit at bottom of clinic weekly, etc)

[AGGR]
* Used to read orderflow for scalping in real time.
* Can see sellers on the m1 chart for Binance Spot, Coinbase Spot, Bitfinex Spot, Bybit Spot, Okex Spot, Binance Perps, ByBit Perps, Okex Perp, Hyperliquid Perps
* AGGR is used to look at climax, initiation, momentum loss and exhaustion for both buyer and seller sides
* Very important for trade management during scalps / LTF trades
*

[OI / Open Interest]
* Open Interest = number of trades open
* OI Surge = lots of new trades opening
* OI Flush / OI Puke = lots of new trades closing, or getting liquidated
* OI Pukes are the best entry and exit triggers simply because you are entering when a many participants are wrong... people open trades for many reason (to spoof, to hedge), but lots of people closing trades in the same level means that they always, almost get liquidated
* This means that if you long on the same side as the people that got liquidated, you get a better entry than they do

Setups I take (feel free to classify / re-classify and rename)

```
1. Breakout (long) or Breakdown (short trades) - My Thesis is price leaving value (vWAP / VAH / VAL) and accepting outside of value. These entries can be actioned from any level.
2. Mean Reversion - My Thesis is the exact opposite of a breakout trade - Price reverting back from the external ranges: from VAH 2SD or VAL 2SD back to the center (vWAP). These trades are best actioned from VAH 2SD or VAL 2SD.
3. CME Gap Fills - My Thesis is filling a gap left by the CME charts. The BTC CME Chart closes on weekends and holidays, so the price disparity between Friday's price and Monday's price is called the CME Gap. The normal BTC chart has revisited this level (price revisiting Friday / the Holiday price and re-tagging the level)
4. Mean to Edge Trades - Thesis is there is a strong trigger that occurs in the middle of a range (AGGR climax, OI flush, etc) - most risky for me as it is easy to get direction wrong in the middle of the trades
